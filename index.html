            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a growth Developer, digital strategist and brand builder who thrives off a challenge. I’m a social butterfly who loves people and building meaningful connections. I’m a leader, a doer and a life-long learner.

                I’m strategic and tactical, a visionary who loves the details, creative, yet practical. I care about tangible results and exceptional work.
                
                People often describe me as: authentic, driven and passionate. Which pretty much means that I really care.</p>
